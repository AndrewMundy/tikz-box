This is the source for an introductory talk on the PGF/TikZ
packages that I gave to postgrads at University of Manchester.

The slides require that you have the [Unofficial University of
Manchester Beamer Theme](https://github.com/AndrewMundy/unofficial-university-of-manchester-beamer)
installed.

Everything should build correctly with `make` run twice.
